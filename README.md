The IoT Distance Monitoring System is an innovative project that combines the power of the Wemos D1 Mini microcontroller, the accuracy of the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, and the robustness of MySQL database integration to create a versatile and data-driven solution for real-time distance monitoring.

To perfrom this project, follow these steps:
1. Start by creating a database. In this case, I've named it "distance."
2. Next, create a table in the database using the provided query in the "maketable.sql" file.
3. Copy the "connect.php" file to your local development environment, for example, in the "htdocs" directory.
4. Finally, upload the "distance.ino" sketch to your microcontroller.
